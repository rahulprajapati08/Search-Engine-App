# ðŸ”Ž LangChain - Chat with Search

This is a **Streamlit-based chatbot** powered by **LangChain** and **Groq's LLaMA 3** model.  
It can search the web, query Wikipedia, and retrieve research papers from Arxiv â€” all in real time.  

The app uses **LangChain Tools** and **Agents** to dynamically decide whether to search, look up Wikipedia, or fetch papers from Arxiv based on the user's query.
